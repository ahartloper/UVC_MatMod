# An Updated Voce-Chaboche Material Model

This is the repository for an updated Voce-Chaboche (UVC) material model to model structural steel materials.

The UVC material model combines the nonlinear kinematic hardening rule of Chaboche with an refined formulation of the nonlinear isotropic hardening law of Voce.
This constitutive model is intended to be used for structural steels subjected to cyclic loading.
Notably, accounting for the discontinuous yielding phenomenon is shown to influence the buckling modes of steel wide-flange columns subjected to multi-axis cyclic loading.
Material models are provided for a variety of stress states, the implementations are shown to have similar, if not better, efficiency in terms of model convergence than the built-in nonlinear isotropic/kinematic model in Abaqus.

The theory and implementations of the material model are described in detail in the references below.

## Installation

Instructions for installation are specific to the choice of simulation platform.
Detailed instructions are provided in each of the Abaqus and OpenSees directories. 

## Usage

Specific instructions for use are provided in each of the Abaqus and OpenSees directories.
The examples used to validate the implementations are provided in both the `Abaqus/testing` and `OpenSees/testing` directories.

Material paramters can be found on the OpenSees wiki at https://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/UVCuniaxial_(Updated_Voce-Chaboche)

### Abaqus 2019 and later with Intel oneAPI

(Noted 15 September 2022) Note that the Abaqus UVC UMATs are not compatible in their current form with the Intel Fortran Compiler in oneAPI and recent versions of Abaqus.
The problem is that "allocatable arrays" used to hold a variable number of backstresses no longer appear to be supported.
This issue can be overcome by modifying the use of the allocatable arrays to be of a constant size.
For example, assuming two (2) backstresses, by changing the lines 27-28 in UVCuniaxial.for:
```
27      REAL, DIMENSION(2, 2) :: chab_coef
28      REAL, DIMENSION(2) :: alpha_k, alpha_k_init
```
and deleting lines 47-49.
UVCplanestress.for and UVCmultiaxial.for can be similarly modified.
